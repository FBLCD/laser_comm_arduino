## Description
The FBLCD project, or "_Five-bit Laser Communication Device_", is based on the laser communication between two Arduino boards using 5-bit sequences (formed by 0s and 1s).

Both "Arduinos" are unit blocks that work on their own, and are composed of:
1. LCD screen (Liquid Crystal Display).
2. LDR (Light Dependent Resistor).
1. Laser emitter (LED).

But two are needed to perform operations with communicative intent (as well as one cell phone in need of another to communicate with, but they can work individually).

## Goal/Aim of the project

The purpose of this project is to create an "_encrypted_" communication system that only the two "Arduinos" are able to decrypt/encrypt. The encryption system of this project is unique, designed by us and no one has the ability to translate it if they do not have the decryption key or resort to simple decryption knowledge ("_hardcoded_").
